Raschii
=======

Raschii is a Python library for constructing non-linear regular waves.
Supported wave models are:

- Stream function waves (M. M. Rienecker and J. D. Fenton, 1981)
- Stokes second- through fifth-order waves (based on J. D. Fenton, 1985) 
- Airy waves, the standard linear wave theory

Raschii directly computes the series expansion coefficients (for Stokes waves),
or solves a minimization problem for the coefficients (for stream function
waves). Once the expansion coefficients of the wave has been found you can

1) Compute the free-surface elevation
2) Compute the particle velocities at any point in the wave field (and in the
   air phase by use of the potential-flow solution above the free-surface).
3) Export the wave field to a file in the SWD_ file format (Spectral Wave Data, see
   more below). The SWD library can then be used to compute many other properties
   such as the velocity potential, the particle accelerations, the stream function,
   the Bernoulli pressure, `and several other properties
   <https://spectral-wave-data.readthedocs.io/en/latest/theory.html#spectral-kinematics>`_.

Using the Raschii waves
-----------------------

Raschii can output waves in the SWD_ (spectral wave data) standard file format for
use as the incoming incident waves in flow analysis programs such as potential-flow
or CFD (Euler and Navier-Stokes equations etc). The SWD file format is used by other
linear and non-linear wave-generation tools, such as the non-linear irregular-wave
HOSM solver DNV WAMOD. By supporting the SWD file format you avoid having to implement
your own wave models for all types of waves, and you can instead use a uniform wave
API for all types of linear and non-linear waves and let the SWD library handle the
details of the wave kinematics.

Raschii also includes a command line program to plot regular waves from the supported
wave models and C++ code generation for using the results in other programs, such as
in `FEniCS <https://www.fenicsproject.org/>`_ expressions for initial and boundary
conditions in a FEM solver (if you do not want to link to the SWD library for some
reason).

Installation and running
------------------------

Raschii can be installed using pip, uv, or any other Python package manager that
supports the `Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/project/raschii>`_.
Example:

.. code:: bash

    pip install raschii

You can also run Raschii in your web browser using PyScript/Pyodide, see the 
`online demo <https://raschii.readthedocs.io/en/latest/raschii_pyscript.html>`_!


Using Raschii from Python
.........................

An example of using Raschii from Python:

.. code:: python

    import raschii
    
    fwave = raschii.FentonWave(height=0.25, depth=0.5, length=2.0, N=20)

    print(fwave.surface_elevation(x=0))
    print(fwave.surface_elevation(x=[0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3]))
    print(fwave.velocity(x=0, z=0.2))

This will output:

.. code:: output

    0.67352456
    [0.67352456 0.61795882 0.57230232 0.53352878]
    [0.27263788 0.        ]

See the `documentation <https://raschii.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>`_ for more
information on the available parameters, methods and attributes of the wave classes.


Using Raschii from the command line
...................................

You can also use Raschii from the command line. You can plot the wave
elevation and particle velocities, and also write SWD files. See the 
help for the command line programs to get detailed usage info.

.. code:: bash

  python -m raschii.cmd.plot -h
  python -m raschii.cmd.swd -h

Substitute ``python`` with ``python3`` or ``uv run``  as appropriate to your installation.
You must install the ``matplotlib`` Python package to be able to use the plot command.

An example of using Raschii from the command line:

.. code:: bash

  # Plot a 0.2 m high wave that is 2 meters long in 1.5 meters water depth
  # Some information about the wave is also shown
  python -m raschii.cmd.plot -N 5 Fenton 0.2 1.5 2

  # The same, specified by wave period instead of wave length
  python -m raschii.cmd.plot -N 5 --period 1.2 Fenton 0.2 1.5

  # Save the same stream function wave to a SWD file
  python -m raschii.cmd.swd -N 5 fenton.swd Fenton 0.2 1.5 2

The plot tool allows comparing multiple waves, the SWD file writer only
supports a single wave at a time and does currently not support Airy waves.

Releases
--------

Development version
...................

New features:

- Current speed for Fenton waves. Give ``current`` (positive in the direction of wave propagation)
  together with ``period`` to find the wave length like in the Fourier program by John Fenton. The
  period is the one seen from a fixed point, i.e., the Doppler shifted period. The
  ``current_criterion`` input selects how the current is defined, either ``"eulerian"`` (default,
  the mean velocity at a fixed point below the troughs) or ``"stokes"`` (the mean mass transport
  velocity). The default ``current=0`` gives the same waves as before. SWD files cannot represent
  a wave with a current.

Changes:

- Fenton ``acceleration()`` is now the full material derivative Du/Dt, including the convective
  terms, and not only the local derivative du/dt.

- For Fenton waves with infinite depth (``depth=-1``) the vertical coordinate ``z`` of
  ``velocity()``, ``acceleration()``, ``stream_function()`` and ``velocity_potential()`` is now
  measured from the still water level (``z < 0`` is below it). Air-phase blending is not supported
  for infinite depth waves.

Bug fixes:

- Fenton ``velocity()``, ``acceleration()`` and ``stream_function()`` no longer overflow for deep
  water waves, and a user supplied ``num_steps`` is now used.

Version 2.0.0 - July 7. 2026
............................

New features:

- More vectorization of inputs is now implemented, you can compute elevations and velocities for
  multiple positions and multiple time steps at the same time. Thanks to jasperpato in
  `pull request #7 <https://github.com/TormodLandet/raschii/pull/7>`_!
  
  In addition TormodLandet has added a few more vectorized methods and changed the output shape of
  some methods for consistency (see below).

- Fluid particle acceleration for Fenton waves. Thanks to jasperpato in
  `pull request #7 <https://github.com/TormodLandet/raschii/pull/7>`_! 

A few **backwards incompatible** changes were made in this release:

- Rename class ``RasciiError`` to ``RaschiiError``. Also thanks to jasperpato for spotting the
  typo in the class name in `pull request #7 <https://github.com/TormodLandet/raschii/pull/7>`_.

- Rename attribute ``T`` to ``period`` for the wave classes. The classes allready have attrubutes
  named the same as the constructor inputs: ``height``, ``depth``, and ``length``. The attribute was
  the odd one out that did not match the constructor input name. Other short-name attributes like
  the celerity attribute ``c`` are not renamed since they are not constructor inputs.

- Return scalar surface elevation (and velocity potential) when the input are all scalar.
  If you give arguments ``(x=1.0, t=0.0)``, the return value will be a scalar, but if you give
  arguments ``(x=[1.0], t=0.0)`` the return value will be a 1D array with one element.
  
  This is the same convention as used by numpy, and is a bit more consistent now that we support
  more vectorized operations.

- Wave-model-class constructors arguments: only height, depth, and length are allowed to be
  positional, all other arguments (N, period etc) must be keyword arguments.

- Move the ``*_cpp`` methods to a separate ``raschii.cpp`` module. If you are one of the extremely
  few users of the C++ code generator you must replace, e.g., ``wave.velocity_cpp`` with the new
  ``wave.cpp.velocity``. This reduces the size of the main wave classes and keeps little-used
  functionality separate from the main code base.

- Other internal API renames and moves. The wave classes are moved to different module names which
  is not considered a breaking change since the wave classes should be imported directly from the
  ``raschii`` module, e.g. ``from raschii import FentonWave``.

- Bumped minimum version of Python to 3.11 (first release in 2022) and the minimum version of our
  only dependency, numpy, to 2.2 (first release in 2024).

Version 1.2.0 - July 3. 2026
............................

This is likely the last release of Raschii 1.x. The next release will be Raschii 2.0, which will
include some breaking changes to the API and will require Python 3.12 or newer.

- Support for writing ``amp=2`` and ``amp=3`` SWD files.
- Support for calculating the velocity potential.
- Refactored SWD writer and tests. 

Version 1.1.1 - Unreleased
............................

- Use PyScript to run Raschii in the browser (instead of the incomplete Dart port).
- Increase the speed of the SWD file writer

Version 1.1.0 - Jun 18. 2025
.............................

- Support for giving the wave period instead of the wave length
- Support for infinite depth waves. This is not fully complete, but should be
  sufficient to export proper SWD files for infinite depth waves.
  Set depth=-1 to use infinite depth waves.
- Better testing of the SWD file exporter when the SpectralWaveData package is not installed
  by including a simplified SWD file reader for the tests.
- Move repository and CI to GitHub. Tested on Python 3.10 (Ubuntu 22.04), and Python 3.12 (uv).

Version 1.0.7 - Sep 30. 2024
.............................

- Support for numpy 2.1
- Drop support for Python 3.9 and older (`following numpy <https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html>`_)
- Added testing with latest Python available via uv (currently CPython 3.12)

Version 1.0.6 - Jun 28. 2024
.............................

- Support for numpy 2.0
- Add type annotations
- Add API docs for public API functions

Version 1.0.5 - Jan 25. 2024
............................

- Update the documentation
- Unbreak the read-the-docs builder
- Switch to pyproject.toml from setup.py (replace setuptools with hatchling)
- No new code or functionality added or removed, just housekeeping

Version 1.0.4 - Aug 28. 2020
............................

- Add the ``raschii.cmd.plot`` and ``raschii.cmd.swd`` command line programs

Version 1.0.3 - Aug 28. 2020
............................

- Fix missing time dependency in Stokes surface elevation
- Ensure all wave models implement ``T`` and ``omega`` attributes
- Test that the surface elevation has the correct period for all wave models
- Include `SWD <https://github.com/SpectralWaveData/spectral_wave_data>`_ file 
  format support for writing generated waves to files for interchange with other
  tools.

Version 1.0.2 - Jun 4. 2018
............................

Some more work on air-phase / water phase velocity blending 

- Change the air blending zone to be horizontal at the top (still follows the
  wave profile at the bottom). The air phase blending still has no influence on
  the wave profile or water-phase velocities, but the transition from blended to
  pure air-phase velocities is now a bit smoother for steep waves and the 
  divergence of the resulting field is lower when projected into a FEM function
  space (analytically the divergence is always zero).  

Version 1.0.1 - May 31. 2018
............................

Small bugfix release

Below you will find a short introduction to using Raschii as a library in your Python code.
This is the recommended way to use Raschii, but you can also use it as a command line tool,
see :ref:`command_line_interface` for more information on that.

Basic usage
===========

Most of the interaction with Raschii will be through a WaveModel object. To get
such an object, first get the class and then instantiate the class to get the
wave model

.. code-block:: python

    import raschii

    WaveModel, AirModel = raschii.get_wave_model("Fenton")

    wave = WaveModel(height=12, depth=200, length=100, N=5)

The resulting ``WaveModel`` class will be one of :class:`~raschii.AiryWave`,
:class:`~raschii.StokesWave`, or :class:`~raschii.FentonWave`, depending on
which wave model you requested ("Airy", "Stokes", or "Fenton").

You can ignore the air model class if you are just interested in the wave. To
show that the maximum elevation for this wave is 207.45 meters you can run

.. code-block:: python

    elev = wave.surface_elevation([0.0, 10.0, 20.0])
    print(elev)

You can get the crest velocity by running

.. code-block:: python

    vel = wave.velocity(0.0, elev[0])
    print(vel)

This will show that the crest velocity is approximately 7.6 m/s.

You can give the wave period instead of the wave length if this is more convenient.
Specifying the period makes the calculations slightly slower, but the answer is still
given almost instantly, so unless you are generating a lot of waves it should not be a
problem. The wave length is computed from the wave period by an iterative procedure
that finds the wave length that results in the requested non-linear wave period. This
is easy for deep-water Airy waves and not so easy for finite depth and higher-order
non-linear waves, hence the need for iteration.


Most common parameters
----------------------

Wave *height*:
  given in meters.
  This is the double-amplitude for linear waves.
  The crests are higher than the troughs are deep for non-linear waves,
  so the height is no longer the double of the wave crest height.

Water *depth*:
 given in meters.

Wave *length*:
  given in meters.
  If you give *None* then the period is used instead (slower).

Wave *period*:
  given in seconds.
  *Only used when the wave length is None*.

Wave order, *N*:
  the order of the wave model to use.
  For Airy waves this is always 1, for Stokes waves it can be 1, 2, or 5,
  and for Fenton waves it can be any integer greater than or equal to 1.
  The higher the order, the more accurate the wave model is, but also the
  slower it is to compute (and for Fenton, the more it is likely to give
  nonsensical results for steep waves, such as finding an irregular
  two-peak solution).

Wave *current* (Fenton waves only):
  given in m/s, positive in the direction of wave propagation (default 0).
  Together with the period this gives the wave length like in the Fourier program by
  John Fenton. The period is then the Doppler shifted period seen from a fixed point.

Wave *current_criterion* (Fenton waves only):
  how *current* is defined, either ``"eulerian"`` (default) for the mean velocity at a
  fixed point below the wave troughs, or ``"stokes"`` for the mean mass transport
  velocity (finite depth only).

See the API docs for :class:`~raschii.AiryWave`, :class:`~raschii.StokesWave`, and
:class:`~raschii.FentonWave` for more information.


SWD: Spectral Wave Data format
==============================

To write the wave elevation and kinematics to the SWD (Spectral Wave Data) file
format, e.g. for use as an incident wave field in a CFD or potential flow simulation,
use the ``write_swd`` method on the wave class

.. code-block:: python

    import raschii

    WaveModel, _AirModel = raschii.get_wave_model('Fenton')

    wave = WaveModel(height=12, depth=200, length=100, N=5)

    wave.write_swd("my_fenton_wave.swd", tmax=200.0, dt=0.01)

More information about SWD can
be found at the GitHub repo at https://github.com/SpectralWaveData/spectral_wave_data
and in the documentation at https://spectral-wave-data.readthedocs.io/ where the
underlying SWD wave description is also described. Raschii waves are stored as SWD
shape-class 2 (long-crested waves in constant water depth with constant spacing
:math:`\Delta k`)

The ``amp`` flag controls what kinematics are stored in the file:

* **amp=1** *(default)*: The velocity-potential Fourier coefficients :math:`c_j` are
  evaluated at the calm free surface (z=0 in SWD convention). Full kinematics at
  arbitrary depth are reconstructed by the SWD library using the vertical shape
  functions :math:`Z_j(z)`.

* **amp=2**: The coefficients :math:`c_j` encode the velocity potential sampled
  directly on the *wavy* free surface, :math:`\psi(x) = \phi(x, \eta(x))`. This
  is intended for nonlinear wave generators (e.g. HOSM) that provide the free-surface
  potential as their primary output. Reconstructing kinematics at depth requires more
  advanced methods such as the H2-operator or a Laplace solver. Current versions of
  the SWD library do not support calculation of kinematics for ``amp=2``.

* **amp=3**: Only the surface-elevation coefficients :math:`h_j` are stored, the
  velocity potential is omitted. This is useful when only wave-surface queries
  (elevation, slope) are needed by the application (smaller files).

.. code-block:: python

    # Write an elevation-only SWD file (smallest file size)
    wave.write_swd("my_wave_elev_only.swd", tmax=200.0, dt=0.01, amp=3)

    # Write a free-surface-potential SWD file (amp=2)
    wave.write_swd("my_wave_surface_phi.swd", tmax=200.0, dt=0.01, amp=2)

The air model is not a part of the SWD file format and the kinematics above the free
surface are hence decided by the SWD library you use and how your program chooses to
use the SWD data. Some versions of OpenFOAM will query the wave model to get the
elevation and only look up kinematics below the free surface, treating the air-phase
totally separately. Adapters for using SWD-files in OpenFOAM, Star CCM+, DNV Wasim and
other wave-simulation programs exist, but currently none that are open source as far
as we know. Writing a custom adapter is relatively straightforward since the SWD
library itself is open source. Interfacing with Raschii waves using the SWD file
format is a recommended way to integrate other programs with Raschii.


Velocity potential
==================

The velocity potential :math:`\phi(x, z, t)` (earth-frame, mean-flow excluded) is
available for all wave models via the ``velocity_potential`` method, using the same
coordinate convention as ``velocity``:

.. code-block:: python

    import raschii

    WaveModel, _ = raschii.get_wave_model('Fenton')
    wave = WaveModel(height=12, depth=200, length=100, N=5)

    # Potential at a single point below the calm surface
    phi = wave.velocity_potential(x=10.0, z=150.0, t=0.0)

    # Potential on the wavy free surface at several x positions
    import numpy as np
    xs = np.linspace(0, wave.length, 40, endpoint=False)
    z_surf = wave.surface_elevation(xs, include_depth=True)  # z from sea floor
    phi_surf = wave.velocity_potential(xs, z_surf)

The gradient :math:`\nabla\phi` equals the oscillatory fluid velocity returned by
``velocity()``.  For infinite-depth waves (``depth=-1``), the method uses an internal
effective depth (25 x wave_length for Fenton/Airy, 50π/k for Stokes) so that
:math:`z=0` corresponds to the effective sea floor.


Air-phase model
===============

Asking for the velocity above the free surface will result in zero. To get velocities
above the free surface you need to specify a method to compute the velocities in the
air phase, see :ref:`sec_blending` and the description of the air-phase models above
that section to understand how Raschii handles this.

The code to compute velocities with an air-phase model is

.. code-block:: python

    import raschii

    WaveModel, AirModel = raschii.get_wave_model('Fenton', 'FentonAir')
    
    air = AirModel(height=100, blending_height=20)
    wave = WaveModel(height=12, depth=200, length=100, N=5, air=air)
    
    vel0 = wave.velocity(0.0, 207.0)  # Slightly below the free surface
    vel1 = wave.velocity(0.0, 208.0)  # Slightly above the free surface
    vel2 = wave.velocity(0.0, 220.0)  # Significantly above the free surface
    print(vel0, vel1, vel2)

This computes the velocities in the air above the crest. In this blended model
the velocities will increase slightly above the free surface before they reduce,
change direction, and then reduce to zero (in the vertical direction) at a
distance ``blending_height`` above the mean free surface. The ``height`` of the
air domain should be at least as large as the ``blending_height``.
